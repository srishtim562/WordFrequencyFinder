# WordFrequencyFinder
This is a word frequency finder, implemented in C. It finds the frequency of words in a particular file. It makes use of the concept of hashing using linked lists in order to achieve this. It gives 5 options to the user:

1. To find the frequency of a particular word in the file.
2. To display the frequencies of all words in the file.
3. To display the frequencies of all words searched so far.
4. To display the most frequent word in the file.
5. To exit.

I have provided 2 text files in order to test the program.
